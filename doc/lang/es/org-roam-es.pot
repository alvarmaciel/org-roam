"Org-roam provides utilities for maintaining a digital slip-box. This section "
"aims to provide a brief introduction to the \"slip-box\", or "
"\"Zettelkasten\" method. By providing some background on the method, we hope "
"that the design decisions of Org-roam will become clear, and that will aid "
"in using Org-roam appropriately. In this section we will also introduce "

"The Zettelkasten method of note-taking is designed to increase research "

"method had produced volumes of written works."

"In its paper form, the slip-box is simply a box of cards. These cards are "
"small -- often only large enough to fit a single concept. The size "
"limitation encourages ideas to be broken down into individual "
"concepts. These ideas are explicitly linked together. The breakdown of ideas "
"encourages tangential exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for "
"thought. Making linking explicit between notes also encourages one to think "
"about the connections between concepts."

"Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode. Every zettel (card) is a "
